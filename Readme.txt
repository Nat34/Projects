This folder contains practice files. These files were created during the setup, creation and development of a local repository, remote GitHub repository and the exploration of web application development work flow.

Project: To gain a thorough understanding of web application development workflow and tools, including various text editors, version control systems and web browsers.

Technology:  The technology in use for this project are text editors, version control systems, web browswers and Unix command line.  The primary GUI text editor in use is Sublime Text.  Sublime is a crossplatform text editor used to create and modify code.  Other GUI and terminal text editors to be explored are TextMate, Coda, Emacs, and Vim.  Version control is a process that allows one to keep labeled checkpoints in their code so they can always refer back to it (or revert back to it) if this becomes necessary and essential for collaborating with other developers.  The primary version control tool in use is Git.
